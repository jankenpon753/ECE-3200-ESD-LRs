\section*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}
In this experiment, forward and reverse contactor diagrams were created using AutoCAD Electrical. These diagrams are crucial for controlling motors in industrial applications, allowing for the switching of motor rotation direction \cite{motor_control}. The process began with understanding the basic concepts and functionality of forward and reverse contactors \cite{contactor_basics}, which was essential for accurate diagram design.
\\\\
The experiment utilized various tools within AutoCAD Electrical, such as the symbol library, drawing shortcuts, and wiring commands \cite{autocad_tools}. Mastery of these tools ensured precision and efficiency. Additionally, best practices for electrical drawing were followed, including clarity, standard symbols, and proper labeling \cite{electrical_drawing}, which are vital for effective communication among engineers and technicians.
\\\\
The objective of the experiment was to gain a comprehensive understanding of how to effectively use AutoCAD Electrical for creating functional electrical diagrams. By connecting theoretical knowledge with practical applications, the experiment aimed to enhance proficiency in electrical drawing and circuit design, ultimately preparing participants for real-world engineering challenges.

    \item Insert a 3-phase vertical ladder in the schematic.
    \item Draw two horizontal lines from the ladder using the multiple bus tool.
    \item Insert a 3-phase motor at the end of the first horizontal bus.
    \item Add fuses and magnetic contactors to both horizontal buses.
    \item Add an overload relay to the first bus.
    \item Format the drawing with appropriate colors and labels.
    \item Edit the wires using trim and stretch tools.
    \item Verify the diagrams for accuracy.
    \item Save the drawings and project.
